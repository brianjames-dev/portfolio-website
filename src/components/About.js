        <p className="description">
        I'm a creative and detail-oriented developer who loves getting lost in code. 
        Whether I'm fine-tuning UI layouts down to the pixel or architecting backend systems, I thrive on solving tough problems with clean and efficient code.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Before tech, I toured globally as a lead guitarist and stage manager/engineer hybrid in death metal bands. 
        It was an experience that taught me the power of teamwork, humility, and relentless learning. 
        Being on the road for months at a time with the same crew can be exhausting, mentally and physically, which taught me important things.
        Positivity, adaptability, and self-sufficiency, are key to navigating difficult situations. 
        Also, some tact and a touch of humor doesn't hurt.
        These are qualities I now bring to every project I'm involved in.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Today, I channel that same drive into software, blending frontend polish and backend logic into scalable tools.
