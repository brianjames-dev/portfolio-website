        I'm a creative and detail-obsessed developer who loves getting lost in code. 
        Whether I'm fine-tuning UI layouts down to the pixel or architecting backend systems, I thrive on solving tough problems with clean, efficient solutions.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Before tech, I toured globally as a lead guitarist in death metal bands. 
        It was an experience that taught me the power of teamwork, humility, and relentless learning. 
        Being on the road for months at a time with the same crew taught me how to stay positive, adaptable, and self-sufficient â€” qualities I now bring to every project I build.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Today, I channel that same drive into software, blending frontend polish and backend logic into scalable tools.
